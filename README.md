## Laravel Octane

Laravel Octane supercharges your application's performance by serving your application using high-powered application servers, such as Swoole, RoadRunner, and FrankenPHP. Octane boots your application once, keeps it in memory, and then feeds it requests at supersonic speeds. For more information, visit [Laravel Octane Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/octane).

### Benefits of Laravel Octane

1. **Performance Boost**: By keeping your application in memory and serving requests using high-performance servers, Octane significantly reduces the response time and increases the throughput of your application.
2. **Reduced Latency**: Octane reduces the latency of your application by eliminating the need to boot the framework from scratch for every request.
3. **Efficient Resource Utilization**: With Octane, you can handle more requests with fewer resources, making your application more efficient and cost-effective.
4. **Scalability**: Octane makes it easier to scale your application horizontally by distributing the load across multiple workers.
5. **Improved Developer Experience**: Octane provides a seamless development experience with features like hot reloading, which automatically reloads your application when you make changes to the code.
